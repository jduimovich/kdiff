Refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity for details.)

./commit-6186760b/production/components/has/production/kustomize.out.yaml: (object: application-service/application-service-controller-manager apps/v1, Kind=Deployment) object has 3 replicas but does not specify inter pod anti-affinity (check: no-anti-affinity, remediation: Specify anti-affinity in your pod specification to ensure that the orchestrator attempts to schedule replicas on different nodes. Using podAntiAffinity, specify a labelSelector that matches pods for the deployment, and set the topologyKey to kubernetes.io/hostname. Refer to https://kubernetes.io/docs/concepts/scheduling-eviction/assign-pod-node/#inter-pod-affinity-and-anti-affinity for details.)

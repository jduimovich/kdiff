<             description: The GitOpsDeploymentManagedEnvironment CR describes a remote
<               cluster which the GitOps Service will deploy to, via Argo CD. This resource
<               references a Secret resource, of type managed-gitops.redhat.com/managed-environment,
<               that contains the cluster credentials. The Secret should contain credentials
<               to a ServiceAccount/User account on the target cluster. This is referred
<               to as the Argo CD 'ServiceAccount' below.

<                   Optional: If true, the GitOps Service will allow Argo CD to connect
